# What is Win32?
### and where is Win64? <br><br>

Win32 is the 32-bit implementation of the the Windows API. But where is Win64? Win64 is the same API, but with some depricated functions.

Almost all Windows programs interact with the Windows API and in order to use Direct3D, we need an application window. One such provider is Win32.

Note: The windowing platform was made in 3.0 (DOS) so if it looks wonky and awful that is why.

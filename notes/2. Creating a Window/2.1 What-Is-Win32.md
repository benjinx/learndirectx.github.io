# What is Win32?
**and where is Win64?**

Win32 is the main set of Microsoft Windows APIs used for developing 32-bit applications. The binaries for Win32 were stored in System32. But where's System64? well it's *still* called System32. And System32 is now called SysWOW64. WOW stands for Windows32-On-Windows64.

Almost all Windows programs interact with the Windows API and in order to use Direct3D, we need an application window. One such provider is Win32.

Note: The windowing platform was made in 3.0 (DOS) so if it looks wonky and awful that is why.

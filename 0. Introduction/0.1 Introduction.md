# Learn DirectX

Welcome to learndirectx.com. This is a guide for learning DirectX 12. There are many resources scattered about, and this website aims to consolidate them. This project was inspired by learnopengl.com and learnvulkan.com.

DirectX has had many versions over the years. DirectX12 is a vast improvement and rewrite over the previous versions. It has on going support by Microsoft and it's supported on multiple devices. 

We will be comparing DirectX12 to OpenGL and Vulkan, while DirectX can only run on windows it's a good counterpart to OpenGL and Vulkan and they are all worth learning and exploring.

There are many older ways to do some of topics we will discuss but we will be focused on using any newer techniques.

We are building a game engine that supports all OpenGL, Vulkan, and DirectX12. While researching DirectX we found a lack of accessible resources. So we've decided to make this website to rectify it.
